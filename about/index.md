**I began life as a small child.** During that period, I played a little piano and spent summer hours either on the golf course or in the bean fields.

I attended [Augustana College](http://www.augie.edu) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and studied music performance and theory.

After moving to the Twin Cities, I worked in management and development roles for a couple metro-based arts organizations, including a stint as the General Manager of the [National Lutheran Choir](http://www.nlca.com) (a group in which I sang baritone from 2001-2013). One summer, my (future) wife walked through the door to audition for the choir. Several months later, we danced the polka to Michael Jackson at a pub in Fort Wayne called "The Thirsty Camel." Needless to say, it is a match made in heaven.

From 2007-2009, I was a full-time graduate student at the [Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs](http://www.hhh.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota. I earned a Master of Public Policy degree with concentrations in public and nonprofit leadership and management and public finance. 

From 2009-2011, I worked with the University of [Minnesota Extension Center For Community Vitality](http://www.extension.umn.edu/community/) and the Horizons Program on the Saint Paul campus, a very pleasant place to show up in the morning. (Pro tip: the veggie burrito at Mim's can't be beat.) 

In mid-2012, I worked on health policy issues with the [Optum Institute](http://www.institute.optum.com). 

In December 2012, I began working with [Minnesota Senate Counsel, Research, and Fiscal Analysis](http://www.senate.mn/departments/office_bio.php?office_id=1007&ls=).
I work with the Senate E-12 Education Committees on issues ranging from general education 
funding and school board policy, to teacher licensure and local library issues, and most everything 
in between. The job is quite a lot of fun.

You've read this far -- astounding! I'm impressed.
